I have a robust background in cyber security, particularly in application security. At Solutech, I successfully established and led the cyber security team, conducting vulnerability assessments, penetration tests, and integrating security into our software development life cycle. My experience includes implementing cloud security infrastructure, threat modeling, and incident response. I also develop information security policies and contribute to the cybersecurity community through training sessions and my blog, which focuses on application security. My commitment to continuous learning and collaboration ensures I stay at the forefront of cybersecurity practices and technologies. I hold a bachelors degree in information security and forensics from KCA University and participated in the Cloud and Network security analyst track at Cybershujaa.
