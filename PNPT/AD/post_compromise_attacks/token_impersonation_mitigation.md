To mitigate this we can do the following:
1. Limit user/group token creation permissions: This is **NOT** a bullet proof solution.
2. Account tiering: Users should not be able to login to machines they are not supposed to be logging in to.
3. Local admin restriction: People should not be able to create admin accounts on the account.
