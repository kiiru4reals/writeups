This is a univerally accepted standard for measuring the severity of security-related flaws on a scale of 0-10. This score is determined by a combination of elements which include the following:
1. The base score.
2. The temporal score 
3. Envirnment metrics.
### Base metric group
- Relied on by most environments. 
- Uses metrics that are further divided into two they include:
	- Exploitability metrics.
	- Impact metrics
#### Exploitability metrics
1. The attack vector
2. Attack complexity.
3. Privileges required.
4. User interaction.
5. Scope.
#### Impact metrics
1. Compatibility impact.
2. Integrity impact.
3. Availability impact.
4. Scope.
### Temporal metric group
The score changes overtime but not across user environments. The remediation of the vulnerability reduces the score.

The remediation reduces the score.

### Environmental metric goup
This is unique to a particular user's environment and relative to the importance of a vulnerable system.
