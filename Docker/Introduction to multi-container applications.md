According to docker, every container should have its own function therefore, the front-end, back-end and APIs have different functions therefore, they should be running on different containers.

### Why multi-container applications
1. To be able to scale APIs and front-ends differently by databases.
2. For easy versioning.
3. To simplify running processes.
4. To avoid shipping the database engine.
