For this section, we can use the getting started application on docker's GitHub page. We can now navigate to the folder which has the package.json file and create a Dockerfile like the one below

``` Dockerfile
syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM node:12-alpine
RUN apk add --no-cache python2 g++ make
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN yarn install --production
CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
EXPOSE 3000
```
Once we do that, we can go ahead and build the image using `docker build -t getting-started .` let us take a look at the flag that we have added on the above command.
`-t`: This is used to name the container.

We can now run the application using the following command
`docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started`
When we ping localhost:3000 we are able to get our to-do application there. To check if your docker container is running you can enter the following command.
`docker ps`
#### Make change to the application
If we have a change to make in the application we need to effect that change in code and run a new build using the procedures laid out above.
