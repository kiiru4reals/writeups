To persist all the data we create in our application, we need to create a docker volume to persist all the data that is stored in the database.

### Creation and integration of volumes
`docker volume create <name>`
To run the volume we need to to integrate the container running our application with the volume.
`docker run -dp 3000:3000 -v todo-db:/etc/todos getting-started`

This enables us to persist the database.
### Auditing docker volumes
To audit docker volume, we can use the inspect attribute to see details on our new volume. 
To do this we need to first list our volumes then inspect the volume we want.
#### Listing volumes
`docker volume ls`
#### Inspect the volumes
`docker volume inspect todo-db`
### Running the dev server
To run the dev server 

```sh
docker run -dp 3000:3000 \
     -w /app -v "$(pwd):/app" \
     node:12-alpine \
     sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev"
```
When we run the above instance, we are able to note that our change is effected on the server.
