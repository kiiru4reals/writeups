### Install DockerCompose
`sudo apt install docker-compose`

### Getting started 
To get started we need to add a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root of the app folder.

### Writing docker-compose file
#### Setting up the application
1. Start by defining the version
	`version: "3.7"`
2. Define the containers(services) running on the application.
	```yml
	version: "3.7"
	services:
		app:
			image: node:12-alpine
			command: sh-c "yarn install && yarn run dev"
	```
3. Migrate the port miroring command `-p 3000:3000`
```yml
version: "3.7"
	services:
		app:
			image: node:12-alpine
			command: sh-c "yarn install && yarn run dev"
			ports:
				- 3000:3000
```
4. Add the working directory, volumes and environment information.
```yml
version: "3.7"
	services:
		app:
			image: node:12-alpine
			command: sh-c "yarn install && yarn run dev"
			ports:
				- 3000:3000
			working_dir: /app
			volumes:
				- ./:/app
			environment:
				MYSQL_HOST: mysql
				MYSSQL_USER: root
				MYSQL_PASSWORD: secret
				MYSQL_DB: todos
```
Now that we are done with setting up the application, we need to setup the MySQL container 
#### Setting up the database
1. We first need to define a new service let's call it mysql 
```yml
version: "3.7"
	services:
		app:
			image: node:12-alpine
			command: sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev"
			ports:
				- 3000:3000
			working_dir: /app
			volumes:
				- ./:/app
			environment:
				MYSQL_HOST: mysql
				MYSSQL_USER: root
				MYSQL_PASSWORD: secret
				MYSQL_DB: todos
		mysql:
			image: mysql:5.7	
```
2. We then define the volume mapping first, we need to define the volume and then specify the mountpoint in the service config.
```yml
version: "3.7"
services:
	app:
		image: node:12-alpine
		command: sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev"
		ports:
			-3000:3000
		working-dir: /app
		volumes:
			- ./:/app
		environment:
			MYSQL_HOST: mysql
			MYSQL_USER: root
			MYSQL_PASSWORD: secret
			MYSQL_DB: todos
	mysql:
		image: mysql:5.7
		volumes:
			- todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql
		environment:
			MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
			MYSQL_DATABASE: todos
volumes:
	todo-mysql-data:
			
```

#### Final docker-compose file
```yml
version: "3.7"
services:
	app:
		image: node:12-alpine
		command: sh -c "yarn install && yarn run dev"
		ports:
			- 3000:3000
		working-dir: /app
		volumes:
			- ./:app
		environment:
			MYSQL_HOST: mysql
			MYSQL_USER: root
			MYSQL_PASSWORD: secret
			MYSQL_DB: todos
		mysql:
			image: mysql:5.7
			volumes:
				- todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql
			environment:
				MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret
				MYSQL_DATABASE: todos
		
volumes:
	todo-mysql-data:
```

### Running the application
Now that we have finished creating our docker-compose file, we need to add run docker compose, to make sure docker compose is installed we can try and find the version using `docker-compose version`.  We can now run the compose file using `docker-compose up -d` the `-d` flag means that we will run it in the background (detached mode).
From running docker-compose, we get the following message
```sh
Creating network "app_default" with the default driver
Creating volume "app_todo-mysql-data" with default driver
Creating app_mysql_1 ... done
Creating app_app_1   ... done
```
Docker-compose automatically creates a network when you run it. To see the network we created, we run `docker network ls`
We can see that we have a new network created
```sh
NETWORK ID     NAME          DRIVER    SCOPE
38f25fb72201   app_default   bridge    local
45ea9d51201c   bridge        bridge    local
112787420a03   host          host      local
4813f3290918   none          null      local
032407aef0b4   todo-app      bridge    local
```
#### Shutting down compose
To stop docker compose, we enter the following command `docker-compose down`. Once docker compose is down we get the following output
```sh
Stopping app_app_1   ... done
Stopping app_mysql_1 ... done
Removing app_app_1   ... done
Removing app_mysql_1 ... done
Removing network app_default
```
