### Introduction
Docker is a tool that utilises virtualisation on the OS level to produce/run a plethora of softwares in a bundle known as containers. Docker runs on a platform known as the docker engine.

### Getting started with docker
#### Running your first docker container
A container is an abstracted environment that runs separately from your host machine and can be easily transferred from your machine to other platforms.
To ensure that we have docker correctly installed we can run the getting started container to see if everything has been set up correctly.
`docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started`
Note: <b>You have to be superuser to do this</b>
Once you run this command, you should get the following output
```

When you visit port 80 on your browser you will see a success page. Now let us break down the command that we ran on terminal.

`-d` : This flag is used to specify that we want this container to run in the background(detached mode). 
`-p`: This flag maps the container port with our machine port, in this case we want it to run on http which means that we need to first open the internal port 80 and connect it with our machine's port 80. hence `-p 80:80`
`docker/getting-started`: This is the name od the container we want to run.
