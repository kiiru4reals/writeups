### Introduction
The Kubernetes architecture consists of three key items they include:
1. Master node
2. Worker nodes
3. Virtual network

### Master node
This is where the kubernetes "network" is adminsitered. The master node consits of the following:
1. An API server which is the entrypoint to the Kuberentes clusters. 
2. Controller manager: is responsible for keeping track of what's happening on the cluster.
3. Scheduler: Ensures the resources are well utilised and pods are placed in places where resources to run them is enough.
4. etcd: Backup for Kubernetes.

### Worker nodes
This is where the containers are deployed. They are administered using a kubelet. 

### Virtual network
It is responsible for networking of the worker nodes. This brings the nodes together and makes them one big machine
