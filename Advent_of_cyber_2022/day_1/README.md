Someone is trying to stop Christmas this year and stop Santa from delivering gifts to children who were nice this year. The **Best Festival Company’s** website has been defaced, and children worldwide cannot send in their gift requests. There’s much work to be done to investigate the attack and test other systems! The attackers have left a puzzle for the Elves to solve and learn who their adversaries are. McSkidy looked at the puzzle and recognised some of the pieces as the phases of the **Unified Kill Chain**, a security framework used to understand attackers. She has reached out to you to assist them in recovering their website, identifying their attacker, and helping save Christmas.

The challenge for day one aims to teach a beginner different penetration testing frameworks, penetration testing frameworks covered in the challenge include NIST cybersecurity framework, ISO 27000 series, MITRE ATT&CK Framework (my personal favorite) and the cyber kill chain.

We can now open the site and capture flags.

We can use the hints below the puzzle to figure out how the pieces add up.
Hint: <b>Cyber kill chain</b>
We can now proceed to piece up the second puzzle using the hints below the puzzle

We can then proceed to piecing the third puzzle so that we can get our flag

Hint: <b>MITRE ATT&CK Framework</b>

When we fill this, we get the curlprit and the flag, onto day two.
