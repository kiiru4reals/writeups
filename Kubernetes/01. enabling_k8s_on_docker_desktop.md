### Installing K8s
Kubernetes can be enabled in Docker desktop by going to the settings> Kubernetes.
### Testing if K8s work
To test if kubernetes work, we shall create a pod. To proceed, we shall start with creating a YAML file.

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
	name: demo
spec:
	containers:
	- name: testpod
	  image: alpine:latest
	  command: ["ping", "8.8.8.8"]
```

#### Creating our pod
We can then proceed to create our pod using the following command `kubectl apply -f pod.yaml`
We get the following output
```sh
pod/demo created
```
To find out if our pod is running we enter the following command `kubectl get pods`. When we run the following command we get the following output
```sh
NAME   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
demo   1/1     Running   0          10m
```
#### Killing our pod
To stop the process of our pod we can delete it by issuing the following command
`kubectl delete -f pod.yaml`, once this takes place we get the following output
```sh
pod "demo" deleted
```
