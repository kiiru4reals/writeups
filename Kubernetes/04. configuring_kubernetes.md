Kubernetes is configured using a deployment file. The deployment file is responsible for the creation of the pods, services etc. 
### Parts of a configuration file
The configuration file is divided into three parts, they include:
1. metadata: basic information of the configuration file
2. Specification: Defines the container
3. Status: Generated by kubernetes.
