### Introduction
Namespaces can be defined as a way to organise cluster into smaller clusters in abstraction. Namespaces come trace their origins back to Linux which allowed Linux to run abstract a function. Which made it possible for Linux to containerise processes before containerisation became a thing.
### Types of namespaces
Kubernetes namespaces can be categorised into six different categories, they include:
1. USER namespace.
2. MNT namespace.
3. PID namespace.
4. IPC namespace.
5. NET namespace.
6. UTS namespace.
#### USER namespace
The USER namespace is responsible for adding users to a given Kubernetes cluster. 
#### MNT namespace
This makes it possible for clusters to have folders and mounts in them to create storage mounts and folders in a cluster for storing data.
#### PID namespace
The PID namespace makes it possible for a Kubernetes cluster to run its own processes.
#### IPC namespace
IPC stands for Inter-processes Communication is used to perform  communication amongst different clusters. 
#### NET namespace
This makes it possible for K8s clusters to communicate with one another. 
#### UTS namespace
Allows clusters to have hostnames.
