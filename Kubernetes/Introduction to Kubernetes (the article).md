### Introduction
In most cases, we need to have some form of tool that we can use to deploy, scale and manage our containerized instances, most companies opt to use Kubernetes. 

Commonly known as k8s because of the 8 characters between "k" and "s", Kubernetes traces its name from Greek with a loose translation of pilot, leader or governor (hence the helm logo) was the name that managed to get a nod from Google's legal team at the time of formation.

At this point, I take a deep dive in learning and understanding Kubernetes, what it is, how it works and the ins and outs of this technology called Kubernetes. Enjoy.
