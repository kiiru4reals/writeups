This provides a connection between on-prem setups and AWS using very fast network connection options with speeds ranging from 50MBps to 10GBps. 
This reduces the network coses and increases bandwidth throughput. Direct connect is also more reliable than your typical internet-based connection leading to a more consistent network experience.
This is facilitated by AWS partners who make the connection between the company and AWS.
