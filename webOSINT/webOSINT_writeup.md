What's the first thing you do when you are given the name of a business to check out? Fire up the ol' web browser, find the website and check it out, right?  

What if the website, or even the entire business, no longer exists?

That does NOT mean it's the end of the road.  

OSINT researchers may still be able to connect the dots and find useful information on such organizations.

Your job is to find as much information as you can about the website RepublicofKoffee.com.

Spoiler alert the website doesn't exist, and if it does by the time you read this, the website in its current form is not our target.

One way to collect information about a website without directly visiting it is to simply do a search for it.

**Note:**Â Sometimes plugging a website into the search bar will send you directly to the site. Avoid this by putting the site in quote marks. Also note that this will only return results where the full domain name is written out on the website.

Go ahead and google "RepublicOfKoffee.com" with and without quote marks, just to see what happens.



We can start by conducting a whois search on who registered the site by doing a simple whois search.
