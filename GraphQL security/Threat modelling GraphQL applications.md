### The language perspective.
When delving into the world of GraphQL for application development, the choice of programming language becomes crucial. Certain languages, such as JavaScript (JS), offer dedicated libraries for handling GraphQL, which are not only open-source but also subject to scrutiny by security researchers. The availability of these libraries streamlines the development process and enhances security. However, when utilizing languages lacking dedicated GraphQL libraries, developers face the challenge of manually addressing security considerations, like input validation, which may potentially lead to significant security vulnerabilities.
### Validation of input
Unlike some languages that automatically handle input validation, GraphQL does not inherently validate input from user-inputted fields. Developers must take the responsibility of incorporating input validation, especially when their chosen language doesn't provide this feature by default. This proactive approach becomes paramount to avoid potential security pitfalls associated with unchecked user inputs.
### Introspection: A double-edged sword
Introspection is a developer-friendly feature that provides insights into the supported fields in a query. While beneficial for developers, enabling introspection on the GraphQL server opens up a potential vulnerability. Threat actors can exploit this feature to execute scripts that unveil all possible queries that can be made to the GraphQL endpoint, posing a security risk.
### The error-handling angle
GraphQL predominantly uses a `200` status code as a standard response. While this simplifies the response structure, it also introduces a potential security loophole. Attackers can discern errors by inspecting the response, using tools like `jq`. This transparency, while helpful for debugging, requires careful consideration to prevent exposing sensitive information in production builds.
### Exploiting subscriptions
Subscriptions in GraphQL allow continuous monitoring of databases or client-side endpoints, enabling real-time updates. For instance, social media platforms utilize subscriptions to inform users about live stream viewership. However, the use of web sockets for subscriptions introduces security challenges. Encryption of data in transit becomes crucial to thwart potential Man-in-the-Middle attacks. Additionally, vulnerabilities like cross-site WebSocket hijacking must be addressed through proper validation of client origin.
### Misusing suggestions
GraphQL's user-friendly feature of suggesting corrections in case of typos is a double-edged sword. While it simplifies the development process, it also introduces a potential avenue for attackers. Malicious actors could leverage this feature to guess field names in a query, posing a security risk.
