### Introduction
GraphQL is a query language for APIs that was developed by FaceBook in 2015 as a way to improve their mobile experience. GraphQL has rivaled REST as it has proven to be faster and has an architectural style that support rising application development trends such as micro-services. Unlike REST, GraphQL has three key operations which include:
1. Query: This involves fetching requests from the database.
2. Mutation: This operation involves making changes to the existing data such as updates, new entries and deletion.
3. Subscription: This operation involves constantly monitoring a certain data set for changes and updating the user.
GraphQL uses HTTP for communication, for communication to take place the requests need to be parsed into a document, which in turn provides output in JSON format.
### Buzzwords
1. Schema: This is the blueprint of all queries that can be made from the graphql server.
2. Resolver: Recieves the data that has been requested from the queries.
### REST vs GraphQL
|  | REST | GraphQL |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Retrieval of data | REST tends to share more data than is required or less data than what is required when requests are shared. | GraphQL seeks precision by sharing data that has been requested for by the user. |
| Architectural style | Relies on HTTP requests to interact with resources and has multiple endpoints each providing different data sets. | GraphQL relies on a single data call to retrieve data from all sources.  |
| Speed | Based on the 'oversharing' and 'undersharing' challenge faced by REST APIs, CRUD operations take more time before a request is complete | Based on its premise of precision, GraphQL is faster as it only runs its operations on what has been specified which makes it take less time to perform its operations. |
### Usecases.
GraphQL has proved itself useful in development of applications that have complex data requirements take an example of an inventory finance application, this application might require a collection of certain information at one time such as credit rating, borrowing history, user information, products that need to procured with the loan money and other relevant information. GraphQL has proven its capability in handling complex requirements that need to be handled by the application. 
GraphQL has also proven to be useful in development of applications that have a micro-services architecture as it enables the aggregation of data from multiple services into a single response, which reduces the need for making multiple requirements to multiple endpoints.
### Making GraphQL queries
As stated above GraphQL is built on the premise of precision when making requests we need to specify the data that we required we can look at the following query
```graphql
query{
	countries {
		name
	}
}
```
This query returns the response of only country names as requested

We can also make multiple queries to give specific requests as shown below
```graphql
query{
	countries {
		name
		native
	}
}
```
The response

Suppose we want to find out more about a country, we can have a query structured as shown below
```graphql
query {
	country (code: "KE") {
		name
		capital
		currency
	}
}
```
The response
