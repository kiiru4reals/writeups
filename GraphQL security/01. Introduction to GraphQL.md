### Introduction
GraphQL is a query language for APIs that was developed by FaceBook in 2015 as a way to improve their mobile experience. GraphQL has rivaled REST as it has proven to be faster and has an architectural style that support rising application development trends such as micro-services. Unlike REST, GraphQL has three key operations which include:
1. Query: This involves fetching requests from the database.
2. Mutation: This operation involves making changes to the existing data such as updates, new entries and deletion.
3. Subscription: This operation involves constantly monitoring a certain data set for changes and updating the user.
GraphQL uses HTTP for communication, for communication to take place the requests need to be parsed into a document, which in turn provides output in JSON format.
### Buzzwords
1. Schema: This is the blueprint of all queries that can be made from the graphql server.
2. Resolver: Receives the data that has been requested from the queries.
3. Schema stitching: This is the ability of putting different schemas together and creating a gateway that is used to link all the available schemas creating a single integration point for clients.
4. Schema federation: Similar to schema stitching except it lets you to tell the API gateway where to look for schemas. The federation does the stitching automatically which makes it low maintenance.
5. Schema directive: This is a set of metadata that can be used to instruct fields in a schema should behave, they often start with the symbol @ followed by the action eg: `@deprecate`.
### Components of GraphQL
In GraphQL queries are often shared by the HTTP POST method but this is not often the case as there are cases where a graphql endpoint might support the GET method which might open up a graphql endpoint to flaws such as Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Queries are shared in the form of a document which is then processed by the use of a query parser that is responsible for validation of the query against the schema and if there is an issue an error is returned immediately, if the query is well formatted, the query id then passed to the resolver that is responsible for providing a response to the client.
#### Schema
A graphql schema is responsibel for mapping and parsing client requests to the resolver. We can take an example of a schema that allows us to query for countries as shown below

```graphql
type Country {
	name: String
	code: String
}
type Continent {
	continent_name: String
}
```
As we can see we have two different queries that are responsible to get the name of a country and a continent, these queries function independently and can be described as *nodes*, to link our two nodes, we can implement *Edges*. Edges are used to link two nodes so as to make one query richer, think about it as database normalization for GraphQL. An example of Edges is shown below:

```graphql
type Country {
	name: String
	code: String
	continent: Continent
}
type Continent {
	continent_name: String
}
```
From the above example, we added an additional continent field to the Country query which basically is responsible for collection of information in the `Continent` query, it is important to note that we cannot use the `Continent` query to retrieve information relating to a particular country but we can get continent information from the country. 
#### Queries
This word is used to collectively rely on a set of operations that take place in GraphQL but in detail, queries are used to fetch information from the graphql endpoint. To perform operations for queries we use the `query` keyword as shown below:
```graphql
query {

}
```
To perform a mutation we use the `mutation` keyword as shown below:
```graphql
mutation {

}
```
To perform a subscription we use the `subscription` keyword as shown below:
```graphql
subscription {

}
```
#### Query Parser
The query parser is responsible for extracting information that is used to execute a query. This is done by changing a query to an Abstract Syntax Tree and validating the query to ensure that it can be executed. 
#### Resolvers
A resolver is used to generate a response to the client's query. This is done by implementing code logic that queries the database, vulnerabilities often tend to exist in the resolver functions as they may be written poorly. It is also important to note that GraphQL may be used to make calls to other data sources apart from databases by making multiple REST calls in the background. This makes it possible for companies that intend to migrate from REST to GraphQL do so easily.
### REST vs GraphQL
|  | REST | GraphQL |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Retrieval of data | REST tends to share more data than is required or less data than what is required when requests are shared. | GraphQL seeks precision by sharing data that has been requested for by the user. |
| Architectural style | Relies on HTTP requests to interact with resources and has multiple endpoints each providing different data sets. | GraphQL relies on a single data call to retrieve data from all sources. |
| Speed | Based on the 'oversharing' and 'undersharing' challenge faced by REST APIs, CRUD operations take more time before a request is complete | Based on its premise of precision, GraphQL is faster as it only runs its operations on what has been specified which makes it take less time to perform its operations. |
| Status Codes | Error codes in REST APIs tend to provide information and actually have a meaning in relation to a certain error. | Code 200 is used pre-dominantly even for failed requests but errors are shown as part of the response. |
### Usecases.
GraphQL has proved itself useful in development of applications that have complex data requirements take an example of an inventory finance application, this application might require a collection of certain information at one time such as credit rating, borrowing history, user information, products that need to procured with the loan money and other relevant information. GraphQL has proven its capability in handling complex requirements that need to be handled by the application. 
GraphQL has also proven to be useful in development of applications that have a micro-services architecture as it enables the aggregation of data from multiple services into a single response, which reduces the need for making multiple requirements to multiple endpoints.
### Making GraphQL queries
As stated above GraphQL is built on the premise of precision when making requests we need to specify the data that we required we can look at the following query
```graphql
query{
	countries {
		name
	}
}
```
This query returns the response of only country names as requested

We can also make multiple queries to give specific requests as shown below
```graphql
query{
	countries {
		name
		native
	}
}
```
The response

Suppose we want to find out more about a country, we can have a query structured as shown below
```graphql
query {
	country (code: "KE") {
		name
		capital
		currency
	}
}
```
The response
