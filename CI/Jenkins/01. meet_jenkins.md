### Jenkinsfile
As earlier stated Jenkins makes it possible for users to make our pipelines using a declarative approach or a scripted approach. A Jenkinsfile is a file that is checked into source control that is used to make it possible for a repo to be accessed, provide an audit trail and to give instructions on things such as code review.
