In this article, I define two approaches that can be used when installing Jenkins (for me). They include:
1. Using docker
2. Installing on bare metal.

### Installing on docker
To install jenkins as a docker instance, you need to ensure you have the following installed:
1. Docker
2. Docker in docker (dind) image: This is not completely necessary as it can be pulled if you do not have it.
3. At least 50 GB of storage.
4. 4 GB of RAM.
#### Getting started
1. Create a docker network called jenkins using the command `docker network create jenkins`
2. You can create navigate to a new folder and create a Dockerfile and add the following
``` Dockerfile
FROM jenkins/jenkins:2.361.1-jdk11
USER root
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y lsb-release
RUN curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.asc \
  https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg
RUN echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) \
  signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.asc] \
  https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y docker-ce-cli
USER jenkins
RUN jenkins-plugin-cli --plugins "blueocean:1.25.8 docker-workflow:521.v1a_a_dd2073b_2e"
```
3. Build your image using `docker build -t <proposed_image_name>`
4. Run your container `docker run -dp 8080:8080 <container_name>`

### Installing on bare metal
In my case bare metal (read Linux, Debian to be specific) you can run the following commands to install Jenkins on your machine.
`curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \ /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null`
`echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \ https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \ /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null`
`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt install jenkins`

#### Bonus: Running Jenkins
To run Jenkins you need to enable the jenkins service by running the following commands
`sudo systemctl enable jenkins`
`sudo service start jenkins`
You can then navigate to port 8080 of your Jenkins server to access Jenkins.
