### Introduction
This is a Continuous Integration tool that sets to automatically build, test and deploy your code to a staging or production environment. Jenkins has an interesting way of creating a pipeline. This includes:
1. Scripted pipeline: This can be a script written in any programming language that instructs the Jenkins instance to perform a certain series of tasks to build a pipeline.
2. Declarative instance: This is a script that is manually written and stored in your repository and triggered when there is a change on a particular branch.
