Now that we have an idea of creating a pipeline, we can easily go ahead and create a pipeline by following the same steps but in this case we shall select pipeline and not freestyle job.
Once we do that, we are greeted with a new menu which has a tab for the pipeline.
Our pipeline is based on a Maven script, that I got as a Jenkins template.
```Java
pipeline {
    agent any

    tools {
        // Install the Maven version configured as "M3" and add it to the path.
        maven "M3"
    }

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Get some code from a GitHub repository
                git 'https://github.com/jglick/simple-maven-project-with-tests.git'

                // Run Maven on a Unix agent.
                sh "mvn -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true clean package"

                // To run Maven on a Windows agent, use
                // bat "mvn -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true clean package"
            }

            post {
                // If Maven was able to run the tests, even if some of the test
                // failed, record the test results and archive the jar file.
                success {
                    junit '**/target/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml'
                    archiveArtifacts 'target/*.jar'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This test just outlines that it should build code from a GitHub repository and run Maven on a Unix agent and upon completion, store the results on an XML file and zip them.

Once we run this pipeline we should be able to see the status of the build and find out if it has passed or failed.
