Cybersecurity has been one of the most talked about and one of the least understood indurstries by many industrial players. This has also led to creation of TV shows and movies that tend to potray it as an easy thing to master and do everyday but in real sense it takes a lot of time and skills to master.

The purpose of this blog is to provide an insider's opinion on the stepping stone to get into cybersecurity and state rather unpopular opinions that have been perceived to be true by recruiters, people from different fields and university professors.

Cybersecurity is a relatively wide field that covers web security, mobile security, enterprise security, cloud security, DevSecOps, Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC), forensics among many other fields. To chart a career path I recommend taking a look at [Cyberseek](https://cyberseek.org), a website that assists newbies, recruiters and educators to explore the cybersecurity career paths and to watch this video by Hackersploit [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6t7u9Wf0l4) as he talks about what it takes to be in cybersecurity and not desecrating the cybersecurity industry.

As one begins their cybersecurity journey, it is important for one to understand how the Windows and Linux Operating Systems, this is because the cybersecurity journey starts from one's computer. The average human being interacts with a computer that runs the windows operating system, therefore, one needs to understand the windows file system, Desktop, control panel, system configuration, resource monitoring, the windows registry and windows security tools. Servers and people in cybersecurity use Linux which makes it important for one to understand how Linux works by understanding the different terminal commands, permissions, process management, file management among other topics on Linux. 

Computer networking is one of the most important and fundamental steps in understanding how computers communicate with one another within and outside a network. One needs to understand the various networking protocols, routing and switching essentials and hwo networks scale. 

Understanding how the internet works builds on top of your networking knowlege and this cannot be done without having a knowlege of computer networks one needs to fully understands how the DNS protocol works at this point and a basic understanding of how web design works. I would recommend learning how to read the PHP language and maybe Django or javascript (you should be able to read and understand code beause at the end of the day you aren't learning to be a programmer). 

It is also important to have an open mind, enthusiasm and the ability to take notes as they learn, to keep this post short I shall attach a link to [Oste's notion](https://05t3.notion.site/Resources-49f48b8b11384dac8052d3dcd5967c72) with resources to learn the above and many more things on matters cybersecurity.

In conclusion, learning cybersecurity requires one to have a grasp on the Windows and Linux Operating Systems, networking concepts and web design. It is also important to note that I have not mentioned any certifications in the above post as certifications are meant to be the next step after one gets a footing in the cybersecurity world and fully understands what they want from their career.
