In the last one year, we have seen a number of business entities from all sectors start performing Data Protection Impact Assessments and hiring for a position such as Data Protection Officer. This is a move inspired by ensuring that they comply to the Data Protection Act of 2019 and to be 'cyber secure'.

For an organization to know what data to secure, we need to classify the data sets that are collected to show if it is personal data or sensitive personal data. This classification also involves determining what data is public, internal and confidential. 
#### Development of an Incident Response Plan
This step is very important as it requires one to have a plan covering how a business organization will respond to an incident when it happens 
#### Designing features with security in mind
To prevent breaches software vendors and developers should avoid rushing to the market quickly by having a half-assed product with no security measures as this makes it easy for threat actors to carry out attacks on web applications with little or no application security practices.
#### Hiring the right people and paying them well
