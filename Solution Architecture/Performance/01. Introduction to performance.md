Performance is about how fast or how slow a web application processes data under two circumstances:
1. Given workload: Number of requests and amount of data.
2. Given hardware: Kind of data, capacity of data.
Performance problems occur as result of improper queue management on the following levels:
- Network
- CPU
- Memory
- Disk
These queues build up as a result of the following reasons:
- Inefficient slow processing
- Serial resource access
- Limited resource capacity
### Performance principles
Performance revolves around the following aspects:
1. Efficiency
2. Concurrency
3. Capacity
### System performance objectives
There are two objectives when measuring system performance, they include:
1. Minimize request-response latency
2. Maximize throughput
