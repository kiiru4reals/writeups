### Introduction
Information disclosure is a class of web related vulnerabilities where a web application tends to display more information than what is necessary. The excessive information displayed may include but is not limited to:
1. Debug messages.
2. Other user information.
3. Specific error messages.
4. Developer comments.

Information disclosure can be leveraged by threat actors to perform high severity attacks or in some cases understand how the system works.
