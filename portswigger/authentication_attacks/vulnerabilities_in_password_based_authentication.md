In many web applications, their authentication models is based on having them enter a username and password. This in my opinion can either be the weakest or the strongest implementation of authentication depending on how it is implemented. 
To perform this attack we basically have to rely on bruteforce attack to come up with the following:
1. Bruteforcing usernames
2. Bruteforcing passwords.
We can also enumerate usernames and passwords based on the following:
1. Status codes.
2. Error messages
3. Response times.

### Brute-force attacks
This is when an attacker tries to guess valid user credentials by using a wordlist of usernames or emails and passwords. This is done not only by using emails and passwords but also by using publicly available information to fine-tune the attacks.
