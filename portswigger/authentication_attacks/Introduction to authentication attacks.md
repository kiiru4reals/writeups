Authentication attacks stem from either two points of failures:
1. A failure in logic
2. Bruteforcing attacks.

Authetication is based out of three things:
1. Something that you know this can be a password.
2. Something that you have this can be an OTP code shared with you. 
3. Something that you are this can be your fingerprint or face scan*

### Authentication vs Authorization
Authentication is used to check if you are who you say you are. This is done by the three things that are used to authenticate a user.
Authorization is the confirmation that you are allowed to perform an action. You may be logged in to a property management system but you are not allowed to change your house or view other people's payment patterns.

### Continuation
This topic shall cover the following sub-topics at length.
1. Vulnerabilities in password based logins.[[vulnerabilities_in_password_based_authentication]]
2. Vulnerabilities in multi-factor authentication.
3. Vulnerabilities in other authentication mechanisms.
