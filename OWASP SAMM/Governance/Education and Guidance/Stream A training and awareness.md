- This is very important in a situation where we have a zero score for everyone.
- The first step is to ensure that everybody understands the core concepts.
- The next step would be to have specific training for teams. This can be OWASP top 10 for developers, secure design for project management etc.
- This training can be used to define resources.
- The first question would be:
```txt
Do you require employees involved with application development to take SDLC training?
The acceptance criteria for this question are as follows:
- Repeatable and consistent training for everyone.
- Include a basic minimum set of courses
- Require attendee sign-off
- Update training at least every 12 months
- Require training during onboarding
```
If employees are able to take basic training, we need to have customized training as noted prior, the question will be as follows:
```txt
Is training customized for individual roles such as developers, testers or security champions?
- Mandate training for all employees and contractors
- Include input from in-house subject matter experts and trainees
- Include demonstrations/ training of in-house tools
- Track feedback to make future training more relevant
```
Once you have the first two steps set up, the final step would be to track the progress of every employee involved in the SDLC the question is as follows:
```txt
Have you implemented a Learning Management System or equivalent to track employee training and certification process?
The quality criteria would be as follows:
- All training is tracked using a Learning Management System
- Base training material on internal standards and policies
- Manage access to resources based on training attendance
```
