- This requires the presence of an application security strategy.
- You need to have multiple types of metrics
- Metrics are derived from available information
- The values need to be published and monitored by the leadership
### Metric types
#### Effort
- Find out how many training hours have been completed by team members.
- How long code review takes.
- Number of application scans performed.
#### Results
- This measures the results of security efforts such as:
	- Number of security incidents.
	- Number of outstanding patches within a certain period.
#### Environment
- Measure the contect in which security efforts take place such as:
	- Number of applications
	- Lines of code scanned

- Metrics should be consistently measured.
- Metrics should be inexpensive to cover
- They should have a percentage or show what exactly is counted
The first question on the stream is as follows:
```txt
Do you use a set of metrics to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the application security programs across applications?
The acceptance criteria is as follows:
- Each metric is documented.
- The effort, results and environment metrics are used.
- Metrics are collected through an automated process
- Metrics are visible to everyone
```

The second level focuses on presence of KPIs that have been vetted by the leadership and security teams. The question is phrased as follows:
```txt
Did you define Key Performance Indicators (KPI) from available application security metrics?
- Define KPIs
- Ensure KPIs are accepted by leadership and the security teams
- Make KPIs visible to all teams
- KPIs demonstrate the AppSec program success
```

To ensure peak maturity, the strategy should be updated to focus on the application security metrics and KPIs. The question should be as follows
```txt
Do you update the application security strategy and roadmap based on application security metrics and KPIs?
- Review KPIs for efficiency and effectiveness
- KPIs and metrics trigger most AppSec strategy changes
```
