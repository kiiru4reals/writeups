### Introduction
Static Application Security Testing is the process where an automated scan is conducted on your code to determine potential vulnerabilites, this is done when the code is pushed to VCS and this istriggered through a workflow.
Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is the process where packages and libraries used in the codebase are scanned for vulnerabilities.

### Setting up Snyk
On GitHub  got to actions and search for Snyk security, and select Configure as shown below

I looked at the workflow and copied it to my IDE because it is easier. In my case, I have disabled directly committing to the master branch, this is supposed to run on Pull Request (PR) to master.
### Setting up secrets.
At this point, you need to setup your workflow to authenticate to your Snyk account, to securely configure this, we need to add a new repository secret by navigating to the repository settings > Secrets and variables > Actions. I have added my secret and named it SNYK_TOKEN as shown below

### The workflow
This guide may vary depending on the programming language, in my case, I used a Django application, this application was containerized using Docker and the files were pushed to GitHub, before we push it to production, we need to ensure that the packages we have used are up to date, the code is secure and our image is secure.
We need to have this run when a new Pull Request is made to the `master` branch, for Snyk to performit operations, we need to give it permission to read our repository and permission to write the security issues that are found as shown below

We need to first checkout our code  and setup Snyk CLI to check for potential issues. Once this is done, we need to set up our dev environment which is Python as shown below

#### Authenticating with Snyk
TO ensure that Snyk works, we need to create an account on Snyk.io and create a token that we shall use to authenticate to Snyk from GitHub. This allows us to fully tap into Snyk's service and have one point of reference when reports are generated.

Once we authenticate to Snyk, we can now begin carrying out our Static Application Security Test (SAST) on the code base and have the report uploaded to GitHub.

To perform a Software Composition Analysis, we need to first download the application's requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then proceed to perform our SCA and upload the results to Snyk.

Finally, we need to scan our container, before we do that, we need to build the docker image then run the Container scan as shown below
